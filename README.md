# LiveMap

A [Phoenix LiveView](https://github.com/phoenixframework/phoenix_live_view)
Component for displaying an interactive map with dynamic data.

By rendering the map on the server, it avoids the client-side map libraries
for simple mapping needs. Utilizing LiveView, we can also update map data on
the server, and let the browser do what it does bestâ€”rendering markup.

The map is rendered as an SVG, in which each tiles are rendered as `<image>`,
using tiles from OpenStreetMap's tile server by default. All the transforms
are natively handled by the browser for SVG.

Please consult and follow [usage policies](https://operations.osmfoundation.org/policies/tiles/)
of the tile servers.

## Usage

A LiveMap can be added to a LiveView by:

    <.live_component
      module={LiveMap} id="live-map"
      width={800} height={600}
      latitude={10.4197639} longitude={107.1070841} zoom={11}
    >
    </.live_component>

Checkout `examples` for a Phoenix application demonstrating LiveMap usage.

## Installation
